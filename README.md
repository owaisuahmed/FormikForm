# FormikForm
Build A Formik Form Repository for xPro course

Description: This is an exercise in creating and validating a form using the Formik library.

Usage: Download/copy the files and folderes a local folder. If using Node.js, open the command line point to the root folder of the target files, for example "cd path/to/project/root". Then run "npm install" to install all dependencies, and then run "npm start" to start the application in the browser. Open public/index.html and you should see a simple login form with validation. The form should include the following:
-Email field
-Password field
-Submit button

The form implements the following input validation rules:
-If the username or password inputs are empty, display the message "Field required" under the text input.
-If the username is not in an email format, display the message "Username should be an email" under the text input.
-If the username and password pass the above validations, then display the message "Login Successful" in an alert box.

Roadmap: This exercise can be improved in the future by adding features for connecting securely to a database and authenticate a user and displaying a landing page (success) or an incorrect login message.
